              <p>
                Elevated Health Augusta was founded by a team of physicians and nurses with deep experience across 
                emergency medicine and physical medicine &amp; rehabilitation. After years of watching 
                patients cycle through the ER for conditions that were entirely preventable — 
                hormonal decline, severe pregnancy nausea, metabolic breakdown — they built 
                something better.
              </p>
              <p>
                
              </p>
              <p>
                Every protocol at Elevated Health Augusta is physician-designed. Every prescription is physician-signed. 
                Every patient is physician-supervised. Our clinical team works together — physicians 
                and nurses — under direct medical oversight on your individualized care plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the difference between a spa and a clinic. Between an app and a physician. 
                Between feeling okay and feeling like yourself again.
